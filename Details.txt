Build a file-based key-value data store that supports the basic CRD (create, read, and delete) operations. This data store is meant to be used as a local storage for one single process on one laptop. The data store must be exposed as a library to clients that can instantiate a class and work with the data store.

To implement this task, A python file DB.py is developed with class named K. The class K consist create(), read(), readc(), delete() and modify() functions.


Create(key, value)-This function is used to add the key - value pair in the file if the key already exist it will throw an error. This function regularly checks for the data size before adding an element.

Read(key)-This function is use to read a data using key. If key doesn’t exist it will throw an error.

Readc()-This function is use to display entire file and size of that data.

Delete(key)-This function is use to delete the data using key reference. If key doesn’t exist, it will throw an error.

Modify(key, value)- This function is use to modify the value of that particular key. If the key is not presented then it will throw an error.



The result of the functions is store in a text file in the same location where ,the python file Stores, in the json format .
